# **GenAI Use Policy for [Research Project Name]**

**Version 1.0 | Date: [Insert Date]**

---

_Note: This is initial template document generate with help of GenAI - this is
just starting point act as template and should be revise further within research
team._

## **1. Purpose**

This document outlines the principles, guidelines, and accountability measures
for using generative AI (GenAI) as a **supportive tool** in our research
project. It ensures ethical transparency, mitigates risks, and fosters trust
within the team and with external stakeholders.

## **2. Scope**

GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) may be used **only** for:

- Brainstorming research questions or hypotheses.
- Editing or summarizing text (e.g., drafts, literature reviews).
- Generating templates for code, surveys, or workflows.
- Analyzing non-sensitive data (e.g., categorizing public datasets).

**Prohibited uses**:

- Creating or fabricating data/results.
- Writing entire sections of papers/reports without human validation.
- Replacing human judgment in ethical decisions or peer review.

---

## **3. Ethical Guidelines**

### **3.1 Transparency**

- **Disclosure**: All uses of GenAI **must** be explicitly documented in
  methods/appendix sections of publications.
- **Citation**: Follow institutional guidelines (e.g.,
  [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt),
  [MLA](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/)) to credit AI tools.
- **No Plagiarism**: AI-generated text/code must be verified for originality
  (e.g., plagiarism checks).

### **3.2 Accountability**

- **Human Oversight**: A team member is responsible for validating all AI
  outputs (e.g., fact-checking, code testing).
- **Data Privacy**: Never input sensitive, confidential, or personal data into
  public GenAI tools.

### **3.3 Bias & Fairness**

- Acknowledge and mitigate potential biases in GenAI outputs (e.g., skewed
  literature summaries).

---

## **4. Transparency Requirements**

- **Logbook**: Maintain a shared log (e.g., spreadsheet) detailing:
  - Date of GenAI use.
  - Tool used (e.g., ChatGPT-4).
  - Purpose (e.g., "Drafting survey introduction").
  - Team member responsible for validation.

## **5. Team Responsibilities**

| Role                | Responsibility                                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lead Researcher** | Final approval of GenAI use cases.                                     |
| **All Members**     | Document AI use, flag biases/errors, and update this policy as needed. |
| **Data Manager**    | Ensure compliance with data privacy rules.                             |

---

## **6. Review Process**

- This document will be reviewed **quarterly** or when:
  - New GenAI tools are adopted.
  - Ethical concerns arise (e.g., institutional policy changes).

---

## **7. Examples of Acceptable vs. Unacceptable Use**

| **Acceptable**                                              | **Unacceptable**                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Using ChatGPT to brainstorm keywords for literature review. | Using ChatGPT to write the "Results" section without verification.  |
| Using Claude to debug a code snippet.                       | Uploading confidential participant data to an AI tool for analysis. |

---

## **8. Team Agreement**

By signing below, team members acknowledge they have read and will adhere to
this policy:

| **Name** | **Signature** | **Date** |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| [Name]   | [Signature]   | [Date]   |

---

## **9. Version History**

| Version | Date   | Changes                            |
| ------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| 1.0     | [Date] | Initial draft for team discussion. |

---

### **Next Steps for Discussion**

1. Define a process for logging GenAI use (tools/format).
2. Clarify citation standards (e.g., APA vs. institutional).
3. Identify high-risk tasks where GenAI should be avoided.

This document is a **living framework**â€”revise it collaboratively as your
project evolves. Encourage team members to propose amendments during meetings or
via a shared feedback channel.
